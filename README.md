# You vs. the Internet Chess

You vs. the Internet Chess is a silly game where instead of playing your game normally against a single opponent, your opponent is the Internet...or rather a series of different players each making one move in a game against you. 

## Components 

YVIC is built on Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js (using Coffeescript), and uses my [Chess Rules](https://github.com/edpaget/chess-rules) gem to verify the legality of moves and produce algebraic notation. 

## Current State and Plans

Right now it doesn't work because I haven't finished it yet. ;)

Eventually it will work. 

Other goals include: 
* Keep track of the player's ELO rating against the internet moves
* Connect to a Chess Engine to evaluate players moves and make some sort of leaderboard for people make good moves
